# MERN Airbnb Clone

This is a starter template for a MERN stack application using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
The backend is built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Express](https://expressjs.com), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com), and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io). There is also a Postman collection for testing the API. JWTs are stored
in secure, HTTP-only cookies. The frontend is built with [React](https://react.dev), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest).
